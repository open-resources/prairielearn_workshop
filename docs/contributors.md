## Firas Moosvi

Dr. Firas Moosvi is a Lecturer at the University of British Columbia Okanagan in the Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, and Statistics department.
Though he obtained PhD in Physics, he has taught large undergraduate courses in computer science, data science, statistics, and physics over the last 5 years at the graduate and undergraduate levels.
In January of 2022, Dr. Moosvi was awarded the UBCO Teaching Excellence \& Innovation Award.
Dr. Moosvi is a huge proponent of the use of learning technologies in classrooms, particularly of the free and open source varieties. 
He has been using the PrairieLearn for over two and a half years and has developed a large open problem bank in physics based on the OpenStax physics textbook in collaboration with other instructors.

## Dirk Eddelbuettel

Dr.~Dirk Eddelbuettel is an (adjunct) Clinical Professor in the Department of Statistics at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign where he teaches a class on [Data Science Programming Methods](https://stat447.com), which makes extensive use of PrairieLearn.

## Craig Zilles

Craig Zilles is a Professor in the Computer Science department at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
His current research focuses on applying computing and data analytics to education, including the development of the Computer-based Testing Facility.
Dr. Zilles has been widely recognized for excellent teaching at the undergraduate level.
He has received the campus Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching in 2018, the IEEE Education Society's 2010 Mac Van Valkenburg Early Career Teaching Award, the College of Engineering's Rose Award and Everitt Award for Teaching Excellence, and Illinois Student Senate Teaching Excellence Award.

## Steven Wolfman
Dr. Steven Wolfman is a Professor of Teaching at the University of British Columbia and currently holds the role of Associate Head of Operations within the Computer Science Department.
He has over 18 years of experience teaching a variety of courses and has been awarded numerous departmental teaching awards as well as the prestigious Killam award for excellent teaching.
Dr. Wolfman's professional interests are in the intersection of technology and learning: methods to enhance learning through technology, use of technology to understand phenomena of learning, and pedagogy of computer science.
He is a contributor to the PrairieLearn platform and has developed an external grader for Haskell, and added functionality to the Python autograder.

## Fraida Fund

Fraida Fund is a Research Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering at the NYU Tandon School of Engineering, with affiliations at NYU WIRELESS and the New York State Center for Advanced Technology in Telecommunications (CATT). She is active in the development of experiential learning materials using open-access computer science research infrastructure, and her lab materials have had uptake at a wide range of universities in the United States and around the world. She uses PrairieLearn to teach a variety of graduate and undergraduate courses in electrical and computer engineering.

## Laura K. Alford

Dr. Laura K. Alford is a lecturer at the University of Michigan, College of Engineering.
She has taught the engineering CS1 course since 2015.
This large course (600-700 students) switched from traditional paper-based exams to more frequent online assessments, hosted on PrairieLearn.
This switch improved equity in student learning and reduced faculty workload.
She plans to describe how she uses a thoughtful breakdown of the most common student mistakes to create automatically randomly generated answers to questions targeted at assessing the core computing skills taught in the course.

## Jonatan Schroeder

Dr. Jonatan Schroeder is an Assistant Professor Teaching Stream at York University, in Toronto.
He completed his Ph.D in Computer Science at the University of British Columbia (UBC) in 2016, in the area of Distributed File Systems.
Originally from Brazil, he received a B.Sc and a M.Sc. in Computer Science from the Federal University of Paran√°.
His areas of interest include Computer Science Education, Operating Systems, Computer Networks, Computer Architecture, Security and Fault Tolerance.
He has taught courses in a wide variety of areas of Computer Science, focusing his pedagogy on the development and use of practical tools to enhance learning outcomes and student engagement.
At York University, Jonatan is part of the curriculum development team for the new Digital Technologies program at the upcoming Markham campus.
